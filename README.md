Detailed Analysis of Candidate Fit for the Test Manager Position


### Best Match: 

#### Michael Dawkins
Reasoning & Analysis

### Strengths:

#### Leadership Skills:

- Michael Dawkins has demonstrated leadership skills through his roles as a Technical Lead at Sword Group and Lead Developer at Capgemini. These positions involved leading teams, which is a critical aspect of the Test Manager role.

#### Cross-Functional Knowledge:

- His experience in leading international teams and delivering custom AI and UX solutions indicates a strong grasp of cross-functional knowledge, necessary for understanding different project domains such as Finance, Purchasing, HR, and Sales & Services.

#### French Proficiency:

- Proficiency in French is a requirement for this position, which Michael Dawkins can fulfill.

### Weaknesses:

#### Lack of Direct Testing Experience:

- The primary drawback in Michael's profile is the lack of direct experience with test management activities such as test planning, test scripting, and anomaly management.

#### Lack of SAP Project Experience:

- Though his resume doesn't highlight SAP project involvement, it is a must-have requirement. Besides, there is no mention of his familiarity with JIRA or Xray, important tools for this role.


### Overall Opinion:

*Michael Dawkins shows a strong technical background with impressive leadership and cross-functional skills. However, significant gaps remain in practical testing experience and specific project management in the context of SAP projects. He might be an 70% match for the role, with the main potential being his transferable skills.*

#### Relevant Interview Questions:

- Can you elaborate on your experience in coordinating and supervising testing activities in your previous roles?
- Have you been involved in documenting testing processes and communicating progress to stakeholders in your previous projects?
- How do you handle resource planning and activity scheduling in a project environment?

### Strengths:

#### French Proficiency:

- Sacha is fluent in French, which is essential for the role.
#### Data Analysis Skills:

- Experience with data analysis tools like SQL and Microsoft Power BI may be beneficial for managing anomalies and creating detailed test plans.
#### Project Experience:

- Sacha's exposure to project work at Sword Group and AiM Services shows some understanding of project management principles, which could be advantageous.
### Weaknesses:

#### Lack of Test Management Experience:

- The job description specifically requires test management experience, which Sacha's profile lacks.
#### Specific SAP Project Experience:

- His CV does not indicate any SAP project experience, crucial for understanding and managing such projects.
#### Limited Exposure to JIRA and Xray:

- Absence of experience with tools like JIRA and Xray, which are mentioned in the job description.
### Overall Opinion:

*Sacha Haidinger does not quite fit the bill due to lacking direct test management experience, specific SAP project expertise, and familiarity with important tools. He might be a 50% match for the role.*

#### Relevant Interview Questions:

- Can you describe a project where you had to coordinate testing activities across different teams or departments?
- Have you worked on projects involving anomaly management and prioritization? How did you handle those situations?
- How do you ensure the availability of resources for a project, and can you provide an example where you had to handle resource planning effectively?


### Conclusion:
Michael Dawkins is the most fitting candidate, albeit not a perfect match. His strong leadership and cross-functional skills show potential but lack direct testing and project management experiences. Training and guidance could help bridge these gaps, making him a suitable candidate to be considered.
